# QTLinkMySQL
A rookie's QT project which connects to MySQL database.

Everyone can try it as their own entry project！

## Introduction
Qt is a free and open-source widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces as well as cross-platform applications that run on various software and hardware platforms with little or no change in the underlying codebase.

C++ can perform both procedural programming in C, object-based programming featuring abstract data types, and object-oriented programming featuring inheritance and polymorphism. C++ is good at object-oriented programming, but it can also perform procedural programming. C++ can create almost any type of program: games, device drivers, HPC, cloud, desktop, embedded and mobile applications, etc. Even libraries and compilers for other programming languages ​​are written in C++.

## Setup
Is the environment configuration important? Not important! Hahahaha, just kidding, the following is my configuration.

QT Creater 13.0.1 based on Qt 6.6.3(MSVC 2019, x86_64)

First, you need to detect the bit rate of your Windows operating system, and then download the ODBC driver. My operating system is 64-bit. Download and install it according to your system in `ODBC Driver` folder.

Then you can create a MySQL database through Navicat. In the database, you need to create a table, similar to the following:
