## Introduction
Qt is a free and open-source widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces as well as cross-platform applications that run on various software and hardware platforms with little or no change in the underlying codebase.

C++ can perform both procedural programming in C, object-based programming featuring abstract data types, and object-oriented programming featuring inheritance and polymorphism. C++ is good at object-oriented programming, but it can also perform procedural programming. C++ can create almost any type of program: games, device drivers, HPC, cloud, desktop, embedded and mobile applications, etc. Even libraries and compilers for other programming languages ​​are written in C++.
